## About

A collection of all the names of chapters in the Holy Qur'an in SVG format.
This was created to help designers and developers who're working on Muslim
apps that need to show names of Surahs. The SVGs were all part of an SVG font.
I had to use the IcoMoon app to convert the glyphs in the font to these files
you're seeing here. I hope it helps :)

## Layout

**Images**

* [svg/](svg/) contains one SVG file per surah
* [png/512x512/](png/512x512/) contains one PNG file per surah
* [png/1500x500/](png/1500x500/) contains one PNG file per surah

**Script**

* [bin/build-png](bin/build-png) is a shell script that's responsible
  for the generation of PNG images. <br>
  The PNG images are generated from the images found in [svg/](svg/)
